Hi, I am siva. I write about security stuff mostly application security, bug bounties and red teaming. I have done my bachelors in electronics and communication engineering. Motivated by the security research bug bounties($$) I took turn to Hacking and now it almost became oxygen for me. For hacking means finding shortcuts to goal by any means. Ethical and unethical depends on what means we have taken our path to get to the target and ofcourse I strongly believe everybody have their own views about this.

 I am always open for collabs as far as it is related to hacking. You can reach me on twitter here [Siva Krishna](https://twitter.com/le4rner).
